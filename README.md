Conjunctive Continuous Performance Task
=======================================

Conjunctive Continuous Performance Task (CCPT) is a sustained attention test developed and validated by [Shalev et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.05.006)

Here is the visual variant of the CCPT implemented in [OpenSesame](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/)

The above CCPT is being modified and tested by the Zald Lab to run during fMRI. The modified OpenSesame task file and instructions for downloading the appropriate Windows version of OpenSesame (2.8.3) will be included below once adequate testing has been completed.
